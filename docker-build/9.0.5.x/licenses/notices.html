Entity<br>
   exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>

   source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from 
mechanical<br>
   transformation or translation of a Source form, 
including but<br>

<br>
   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in 
Source or<br>
   Object form, made available under the License, as 
indicated by a<br>
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the 
work<br>
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in 
Source or Object<br>
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and 
for which the<br>
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications<br>
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. 
For the purposes<br>
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include 
works that remain<br>
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the 
interfaces of,<br>
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, 
including<br>
   the original version of the Work and any modifications 
or additions<br>
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is 
intentionally<br>
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the 
copyright owner<br>
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit 
on behalf of<br>
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this 
definition, "submitted"<br>
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written 
communication sent<br>
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but 
not limited to<br>
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code 
control systems,<br>
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on 
behalf of, the<br>
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the

   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a 
Contribution."<br>
<br>
   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or 
Legal Entity<br>
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by 
Licensor and<br>
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of,<br>
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the<br>
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made,<br>
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer 
the Work,<br>
   where such license applies only to those patent claims 
licensable<br>
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their<br>
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
   institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a<br>
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Work<br>
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct<br>
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
   as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the<br>
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without<br>
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You<br>
   meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices<br>
       stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any 
part of<br>
       the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its<br>
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must<br>
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained<br>
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not<br>
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at 
least one<br>
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed<br>
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source 
form or<br>
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or,<br>
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, 
if and<br>
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. 
The contents<br>
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes 
only and<br>
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, 
alongside<br>
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, 
provided<br>
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be 
construed<br>
       as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
   may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use,<br>
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
   the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise,<br>
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion 
in the Work<br>
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed<br>
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of 
the Licensor,<br>
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the<br>
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each<br>
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS,<br>
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions<br>
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS 
FOR A<br>
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any<br>
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under 
this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory,<br>
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate 
and grossly<br>
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to 
use the<br>
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of 
goodwill,<br>
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any 
and all<br>
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer,<br>
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity,<br>
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this<br>
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may 
act only<br>
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not 
on behalf<br>
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

 #  original form or modified, to any third party or 
parties, PROVIDED<br>
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will 
ALWAYS appear<br>
 #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is 
distributed <br>
 #  substantially in the same form as set out herein and 
that such <br>

 #  NO WARRANTY<br>
 #  <br>
 #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in 
the course of <br>
 #  the research and development conducted during the 
project and is <br>
 #  provided to users as so produced on an experimental 
basis.  <br>
 #  Accordingly, the program is provided without any

and fitness <br>
 #  for a particular purpose of the program and the 
nonexistence of any <br>
 #  infringement or violation of any right of any third

 #  <br>
 #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and 
be deemed to<br>

4. Time Zone Database<br>
<br>
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from 
Time Zone <br>
  Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the 
TZ database <br>
  is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the 
Time Zone <br>
  Database section 7.<br>
<br>
  7.  Database Ownership<br>
<br>
    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or 
an IETF<br>
    document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly 
updated work<br>
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain 
in the <br>
    public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 
[RFC3979] do not <br>
    apply to the TZ Database or contributions that 
individuals make to <br>
    it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against 
the TZ <br>
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA 
Considerations <br>
    defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of 
understanding with the <br>
    IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all 
competent <br>
    court orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN 
or the IETF <br>
    Trust on the database or the code.  Any person making a 
contribution<br>
    to the database or code waives all rights to future 
claims in that<br>
    contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It 
also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to <br>
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
Licenses are <br>
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to <br>
make sure the software is free for all its users. <br>
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some <br>
specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free <br>
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. 
You can use <br>
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about 
whether this <br>
license or the ordinary General Public License is the 
better strategy to <br>
use in any particular case, based on the explanations 
below. <br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not <br>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make 
sure that you <br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and 
charge for <br>
this service if you wish); that you receive source code or 
can get it if <br>
you want it; that you can change the software and use 
pieces of it in <br>
new free programs; and that you are informed that you can 
do these <br>
things. <br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid <br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these <br>
rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you <br>
if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify 
it. <br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or <br>
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
we gave you. <br>
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code. <br>
If you link other code with the library, you must provide 
complete <br>
object files to the recipients, so that they can relink 
them with the <br>
library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
it. And you <br>
must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br>
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the <br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you 
legal <br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br>
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is <br>
no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is 
modified by <br>
someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that 
what they <br>
have is not the original version, so that the original 
author's <br>
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 
introduced by <br>
others. <br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any <br>
free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
effectively <br>
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
restrictive license <br>
from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent 
license <br>
obtained for a version of the library must be consistent 
with the full <br>
freedom of use specified in this license. <br>
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary <br>
GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser 
General Public <br>
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is 
quite different <br>
from the ordinary General Public License. We use this 
license for <br>
certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
libraries into <br>
non-free programs. <br>
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a <br>
shared library, the combination of the two is legally 
speaking a <br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The 
ordinary <br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only 
if the entire <br>
combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser 
General Public <br>
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code 
with the <br>
library. <br>
<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does <br>
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary 
General Public <br>
License. It also provides other free software developers 
Less of an <br>
advantage over competing non-free programs. These 
disadvantages are the <br>
reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
libraries. <br>
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
special <br>
circumstances. <br>
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to <br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it <br>
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be <br>
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a 
free library <br>
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In 
this case, there <br>
is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
software only, so <br>
we use the Lesser General Public License. <br>
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free <br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large 
body of free <br>
software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library 
in non-free <br>
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
operating system, <br>
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br>
<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the <br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program 
that is linked <br>
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
that program <br>
using a modified version of the Library. <br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and <br>
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a <br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The <br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the 
latter must <br>
be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS FOR <br>
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <br>
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other <br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright 
holder or other <br>
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the 
terms of this <br>
Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). 
Each <br>
licensee is addressed as "you". <br>
<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data <br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs <br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables. <br>
<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which <br>
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on 
the Library" <br>
means either the Library or any derivative work under 
copyright law: <br>
that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion 
of it, either <br>
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
straightforwardly into <br>
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without <br>
limitation in the term "modification".) <br>
<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making <br>
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code 
means all the <br>
source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface <br>
definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and <br>
installation of the library. <br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not <br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The 
act of running <br>
a program using the Library is not restricted, and output 
from such a <br>
program is covered only if its contents constitute a work 
based on the <br>
Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool 
for writing <br>
it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does 
and what the <br>
program that uses the Library does. <br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete <br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that 
you <br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate <br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices <br>
that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty; and <br>
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and <br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of <br>
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and 
distribute <br>
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided <br>
that you also meet all of these conditions: <br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices <br>
       stating that you changed the files and the date of 
any change.<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed 
at no charge <br>
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a <br>
       table of data to be supplied by an application 
program that uses <br>
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility <br>
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure <br>
       that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function <br>
       or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part <br>
       of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
      (For example, a function in a library to compute 
square roots has <br>
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent 
of the <br>
      application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that 
any <br>
      application-supplied function or table used by this 
function must <br>
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, 
the square <br>
      root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If <br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and <br>
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works 
in <br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply 
to those <br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But 
when you <br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on <br>
the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the 
terms of this <br>
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire <br>
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who 
wrote it. <br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest <br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
intent is to <br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of 
derivative or <br>
collective works based on the Library. <br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library <br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a 
volume of a <br>
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under the <br>
scope of this License. <br>
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public <br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
Library. To do <br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
License, so that <br>
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, 
version 2, <br>
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the <br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you 
can specify <br>
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other 
change in these <br>
notices. <br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that <br>
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to 
all <br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the <br>
Library into a program that is not a library. <br>
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative <br>
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the <br>
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany 
it with the <br>
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 
must be <br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium <br>
customarily used for software interchange. <br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a <br>
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy 
the source <br>
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to 
distribute the <br>
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to 
copy the <br>
source along with the object code. <br>
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, <br>
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled 
or linked <br>
with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a 
work, in <br>
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and 
therefore falls <br>
outside the scope of this License. <br>
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates <br>
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because 
it contains <br>
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the 
library". <br>
The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
Section 6 states <br>
terms for distribution of such executables. <br>
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file <br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
may be a <br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code 
is not. <br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work 
can be linked <br>
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. 
The threshold <br>
for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure <br>
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten <br>
lines or less in length), then the use of the object file 
is <br>
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. <br>
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of 
the Library <br>
will still fall under Section 6.) <br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may <br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. <br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether <br>
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a <br>
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a 
work <br>
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that 
work under terms <br>
of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification 
of the work <br>
for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for 
debugging such <br>
modifications. <br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the <br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
covered by <br>
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If 
the work during <br>
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
copyright <br>
notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
directing the <br>
user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of 
these things: <br>
<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding <br>
       machine-readable source code for the Library 
including whatever <br>
       changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under <br>
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked <br>
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that <br>
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source 
code, so that the <br>
       user can modify the Library and then relink to 
produce a modified <br>
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood <br>
       that the user who changes the contents of 
definitions files in <br>
       the Library will not necessarily be able to 
recompile the <br>
       application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking 
with the <br>
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses 
at run time a <br>
       copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer <br>
       system, rather than copying library functions into 
the <br>
       executable, and (2) will operate properly with a 
modified version <br>
       of the library, if the user installs one, as long as 
the modified <br>
       version is interface-compatible with the version 
that the work <br>
       was made with.<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for 
at least three <br>
       years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in <br>
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the 
cost of <br>
       performing this distribution.<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering 
access to copy <br>
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the <br>
       above specified materials from the same place.<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these <br>
       materials or that you have already sent this user a 
copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" <br>
must include any data and utility programs needed for 
reproducing the <br>
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the 
materials to be <br>
distributed need not include anything that is normally 
distributed (in <br>
either source or binary form) with the major components 
(compiler, <br>
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the 
executable runs, <br>
unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions <br>
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the <br>
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use 
both them <br>
and the Library together in an executable that you 
distribute. <br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library <br>
side-by-side in a single library together with other 
library facilities <br>
not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined 
library, <br>
provided that the separate distribution of the work based 
on the Library <br>
and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, 
and provided <br>
that you do these two things: <br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work based <br>
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. <br>
       This must be distributed under the terms of the 
Sections above.<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
the fact that <br>
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where <br>
       to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the <br>
Library except as expressly provided under this License. 
Any attempt <br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the <br>
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your 
rights under this <br>
License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you <br>
under this License will not have their licenses terminated 
so long as <br>
such parties remain in full compliance. <br>
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not <br>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to 
modify or <br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These 
actions are <br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore, by <br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on 
the <br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all <br>
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying the <br>
Library or works based on it. <br>
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the <br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the <br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify 
the Library <br>
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose 
any further <br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein. <br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties with <br>
this License. <br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent <br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues), <br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
agreement or <br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not <br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot distribute <br>
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and <br>
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not <br>
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent 
license would <br>
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by 
all those who <br>
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the 
only way you <br>
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from <br>
distribution of the Library. <br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under <br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to <br>
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in 
other <br>
circumstances. <br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any <br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any <br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the <br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
implemented <br>
by public license practices. Many people have made generous <br>
contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that <br>
system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to <br>
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute <br>
software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that <br>
choice. <br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be <br>
a consequence of the rest of this License. <br>
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in <br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the <br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this 
License may <br>
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
excluding those <br>
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among countries <br>
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates 
the <br>
limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br>
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions <br>
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new <br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, 
but may <br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. <br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library <br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
it and "any <br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms 
and <br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version 
published by <br>
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not 
specify a license <br>
version number, you may choose any version ever published 
by the Free <br>
Software Foundation. <br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free <br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible 
with these, <br>
write to the author to ask for permission. For software 
which is <br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the 
Free Software <br>
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our 
decision will be <br>
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives <br>
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse 
of software <br>
generally. <br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO <br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. <br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR <br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND, <br>
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
THE IMPLIED <br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. THE <br>
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
LIBRARY IS WITH <br>
YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE 
COST OF ALL <br>
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN <br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
MAY MODIFY <br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
LIABLE TO YOU FOR <br>
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL <br>
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
LIBRARY <br>
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
RENDERED <br>
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF <br>
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF 
SUCH HOLDER OR <br>
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. <br>
