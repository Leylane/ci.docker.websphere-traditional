<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For 
the <br>
purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not

patent <br>
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim <br>
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated <br>
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent <br>
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under 
this <br>
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation <br>

<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work <br>
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet <br>
the following conditions:<br>
<br>
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative <br>
 Works a copy of this License; and<br>

 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
 those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
 Works; and<br>
<br>
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its <br>
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must <br>
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained <br>
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not <br>
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of <br>
 the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
 part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
do not <br>
 modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
 within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or 
as an <br>
 addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that 
such <br>
 additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
 the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and

Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>

You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the <br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed <br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor <br>
provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
     3.1. Application of License.<br>
     The Modifications which You create or to which You 
contribute are<br>
     governed by the terms of this License, including 
without limitation<br>
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code 
may be<br>
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a 
future version<br>
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You 
must include a<br>
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source 
Code You<br>
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on 
any Source Code<br>
     version that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this<br>
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, 
You may include<br>
     an additional document offering the additional rights 
described in<br>
     Section 3.5.<br>
<br>
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
     Any Modification which You create or to which You 
contribute must be<br>
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of 
this License<br>
     either on the same media as an Executable version or 
via an accepted<br>
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom 
you made an<br>
     Executable version available; and if made available 
via Electronic<br>
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at 
least twelve (12)<br>
     months after the date it initially became available, 
or at least six<br>
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that 
particular Modification<br>
     has been made available to such recipients. You are 
responsible for<br>
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains 
available even if the<br>
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a 
third party.<br>
<br>
     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You 
contribute to contain a<br>
     file documenting the changes You made to create that 
Covered Code and<br>
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent 
statement that<br>
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, 
from Original<br>
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including 
the name of the<br>
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in 
any notice in an<br>
     Executable version or related documentation in which 
You describe the<br>
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
          (a) Third Party Claims.<br>
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under 
a third party's<br>
          intellectual property rights is required to 
exercise the rights<br>
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 
2.2,<br>
          Contributor must include a text file with the 
Source Code<br>
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the 
claim and the<br>
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that 
a recipient will<br>
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such 
knowledge after<br>
          the Modification is made available as described 
in Section 3.2,<br>
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file 
in all copies<br>
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall 
take other steps<br>
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups)<br>
          reasonably calculated to inform those who 
received the Covered<br>
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
<br>
          (b) Contributor APIs.<br>
          If Contributor's Modifications include an 
application programming<br>
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent 
licenses which<br>
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, 
Contributor must<br>
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br>
<br>
               (c)    Representations.<br>
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed 
pursuant to<br>
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that 
Contributor's<br>
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation
(s) and/or<br>
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the 
rights conveyed by<br>
          this License.<br>
<br>
     3.5. Required Notices.<br>
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each 
file of the Source<br>
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a 
particular Source<br>
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include 
such notice in a<br>
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user 
would be likely<br>
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more 
Modification(s)<br>
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice 
described in<br>
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in 
any documentation<br>
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' 
rights or ownership<br>
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to 
offer, and to<br>
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability<br>
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. 
However, You<br>
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf 
of the Initial<br>
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it 
absolutely clear than<br>
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is<br>
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial<br>
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the<br>
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty,<br>
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form 
only if the<br>
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that 
Covered Code,<br>
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source 
Code version of<br>
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this 
License,<br>
     including a description of how and where You have 
fulfilled the<br>
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be 
conspicuously included<br>
     in any notice in an Executable version, related 
documentation or<br>
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights 
relating to the<br>
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable 
version of Covered<br>
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your 
choice, which may<br>
     contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in<br>
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the 
license for the<br>
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter 
the recipient's<br>
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set 
forth in this<br>
     License. If You distribute the Executable version 
under a different<br>
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any 
terms which differ<br>
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the 
Initial<br>
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the<br>
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by<br>
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result 
of any such<br>
     terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.7. Larger Works.<br>
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code 
with other code<br>
     not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger<br>
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must 
make sure the<br>
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the 
Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the 
terms of this<br>
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered 
Code due to<br>
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: 
(a) comply with<br>
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent 
possible; and (b)<br>
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. 
Such description<br>
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in 
Section 3.4 and must<br>
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. 
Except to the<br>
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such 
description must be<br>
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to<br>
     understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
     This License applies to code to which the Initial 
Developer has<br>
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related 
Covered Code.<br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
     6.1. New Versions.<br>
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may 
publish revised<br>
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. 
Each version<br>
     will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
     Once Covered Code has been published under a 
particular version of the<br>
     License, You may always continue to use it under the 
terms of that<br>
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code 
under the terms<br>
     of any subsequent version of the License published by 
Netscape. No one<br>
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms 
applicable to<br>
     Covered Code created under this License.<br>
<br>
     6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
     If You create or use a modified version of this 
License (which you may<br>
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not 
already Covered Code<br>
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your 
license so that<br>
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", 
"Netscape",<br>
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not 
appear in your<br>
     license (except to note that your license differs from 
this License)<br>
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of 
the license<br>
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public 
License and<br>
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the 
Initial<br>
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice 
described in<br>
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be 
modifications of<br>
     this License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS 
IS" BASIS,<br>
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE 
IS FREE OF<br>
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NON-INFRINGING.<br>
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE COVERED CODE<br>
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT,<br>
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
THIS DISCLAIMER<br>
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS 
LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder 
will terminate<br>
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein 
and fail to cure<br>
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the 
breach. All<br>
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly 
granted shall<br>
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions 
which, by their<br>
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination 
of this License<br>
     shall survive.<br>
<br>
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement<br>
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against 
Initial Developer<br>
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom<br>
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  
alleging that:<br>
<br>
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly 
or indirectly<br>
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted 
by such<br>
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of 
this License<br>
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate 
prospectively,<br>
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You 
either: (i)<br>
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually 
agreeable reasonable<br>
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications 
made by such<br>
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim 
with respect to<br>
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If 
within 60 days<br>
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment 
arrangement are not<br>
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the 
litigation claim<br>
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to 
You under<br>
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the 
expiration of<br>
     the 60 day notice period specified above.<br>
<br>
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than 
such Participant's<br>
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then<br>
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under 
Sections 2.1(b)<br>
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You 
first made, used,<br>
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by 
that<br>
     Participant.<br>
<br>
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim 
against Participant<br>
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version 
directly or<br>
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is 
resolved (such as<br>
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of 
patent<br>
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of 
the licenses<br>
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 
shall be taken<br>
     into account in determining the amount or value of any 
payment or<br>
     license.<br>
<br>
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 
or 8.2 above,<br>
     all end user license agreements (excluding 
distributors and resellers)<br>
     which have been validly granted by You or any 
distributor hereunder<br>
     prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, 
WHETHER TORT<br>
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL 
YOU, THE INITIAL<br>
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR 
OF COVERED CODE,<br>
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO 
ANY PERSON FOR<br>
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY<br>
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR 
LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br>
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY 
AND ALL OTHER<br>
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN<br>
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF<br>
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY<br>
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW<br>
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE<br>
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, SO<br>
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term 
is defined in<br>
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial 
computer<br>
     software" and "commercial computer software 
documentation," as such<br>
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48<br>
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code 
with only those<br>
     rights set forth herein.<br>
<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
     This License represents the complete agreement 
concerning subject<br>
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is 
held to be<br>
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only 
to the extent<br>
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall 
be governed by<br>
     California law provisions (except to the extent 
applicable law, if<br>
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-
law provisions.<br>
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party 
is a citizen of,<br>
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in 
the United<br>
     States of America, any litigation relating to this 
License shall be<br>
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of 
the Northern<br>
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa 
Clara County,<br>
     California, with the losing party responsible for 
costs, including<br>
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable 
attorneys' fees and<br>
     expenses. The application of the United Nations 
Convention on<br>
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
expressly excluded.<br>
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language 
of a contract<br>
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply 
to this<br>
     License.<br>
<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, 
each party is<br>
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly 
or indirectly,<br>
     out of its utilization of rights under this License 
and You agree to<br>
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such<br>
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or<br>
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of 
liability.<br>
<br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br>
<br>
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the 
Covered Code as<br>
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that 
the Initial<br>
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the 
Covered Code under<br>
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if 
any, specified<br>
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active

ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials

Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is
